- this will be a "master list" of all the ongoing tasks for the oppni code base,
  organized by neuroimaging data type

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(oppni-b)

> add an alignment QC protocol
    * store func1_warped_tav_noal in postwarp --> for qc of e2a
    * store func1_warped_tsd / func1_warped_tsd_nomc --> for qc of motcor
    * use [anat_warped/GM/WM/CSF] ... already obtained, use for qc of flexwarp
    * use [func1_warped] ... already obtained, use for qc of net warp
    - measure (a) difference in intersubj var of full-warp e2a vs. noal [e2a alignment effects]
              (b) difference of intrasubj var of full-warp motcor vs. nomc [motcor effects]
              (c) group similarity of anat_warped/GM/WM/CSF, fun1_warped
    - assess overall fidelity of warping protocol, cf against others

> refactor clustering tool as (a) algorithm itself and (b) nifti wrapper
> make clustering wrapper that takes thresholded image, underlying atlas, +spreadsheet
  and outputs table of clusters with nearest regions etcv.

> step that collects pipeline effic information, then deletes;
  e.g., kurtosis+despike, reho+tshift, var+ricor/motcor,
  and something similar for regression proccing

> pipeline "split-half" option for handling regression processing etc.

> measure amt. of affine motion / nonlinear displacement to check for abnormal cases

> field map integration

> multi-echo functionality

(oppni-d)

> hook up code to generate standard dti metrics + optional dki / noddi stuff

> implement warping protocol

> setup checks for QC, including
    a) validity of b0 reference volumes -- not outliers or corrupted by junk
    b) whether topup was successful in reducing distortion
    c) quality of brain mask
    d) presence of slice dropout and/or slice-wise motion
    e) post-eddy reduction in variance

> implement b0-based normalization of signal:
    (a) global per shell
    (b) global over time
    (c) global over space and time

> integrate PCA-based denoising of mrtrix
